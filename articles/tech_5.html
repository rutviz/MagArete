   <p><i>Currently </i>we are living in world where progress is happening at much greater pace.

Every other day other day new gadgets are unveiled. Chips are getting smaller and

faster, storage spaces are getting larger. Things Internet, IoT, cloud-computing have

changed how people live now-a- days. But still there are some areas which have not

changed all that much over the years. Transportation is one such area. Roads are still

full of cars and skies full of jetliners. Science-Fiction ideas like levitating cars, Hover-

boards,  teleportation are still seen in comics only.</p>

  <p>But still there are some ideas which might change the current scenario. One such

idea is named HYPERLOOP. </p>

  
  <p style="font-size:25px"><B>What is Hyperloop?</B></p>

  
  <p style="font-size:25px; background-color:#eeeeee;padding:10px;">Hyperloop is a concept proposed by inventor , Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX and Tesla

motors. Mr. Musk presented idea of hyperloop at Pando-Daily event in Santa-

Monica, California. He referred to Hyperloop as &quot;Fifth Mode Of Transportation&quot;. He

also added that Hyperloop transportation systems will be immune to water, collision

free , will travel with twice the speed of plane, will have low power consumption and

will also have 24-hour operation. he also believes that the the more advanced

versions of hyperloop will travel at hypersonic speed.</p>
  <p style="font-size:25px; background-color:#eeeeee;padding:10px;">A cross between a Concorde, a rail-gun and an Air-Hockey table&quot;, Musk commented.</p>

  <p>The Hyperloop concept operates by sending specially designed &quot;capsules&quot; or &quot;pods&quot;

through a continuous steel tube maintained at a partial vacuum. Each cap only take

18 minitues ro travel from manchester to london !sule floats on a 0.5-to- 1.3-

millimetre (0.02 to 0.05 in) layer of air provided under pressure to air-caster &quot;skis&quot;,

similar to how pucks are suspended in an air hockey table, thus avoiding the use of

MAGLEV while still allowing for speeds that wheels cannot sustain. Linear induction

motors located along the tube would accelerate and decelerate the capsule to the

appropriate speed for each section of the tube route. With rolling resistance

eliminated and air resistance greatly reduced, the capsules can glide for the bulk of

the journey. In the Hyperloop concept, an electrically driven inlet fan and air

compressor would be placed at the nose of the capsule to &quot;actively transfer high

pressure air from the front to the rear of the vessel,&quot; resolving the problem of air

pressure building in front of the vehicle, slowing it down. A fraction of the air is

shunted to the skis for additional pressure, augmenting that gain passively from lift

due to their shape.

</p>
  
  <p>In the alpha-level concept, passenger-only pods are to be 2.23 metres (7 ft 4 in) in

diameterand projected to reach a top speed of 760 mph (1,220 km/h) to maintain

aerodynamic efficiency; the design proposes passengers experience a maximum

inertial acceleration of 0.5 g, about 2 or 3 times that of a commercial airliner on

takeoff and landing. At those speeds there would not be a sonic boom.......technicality

aside IT IS VERY FAST. It will take only 18 minutes to travel from Manchester to

London, 335.37 kms apart !</p>

<p style="font-size:25px; background-color:#eeeeee;padding:10px;">WHY THE NEED ?<br>
Conventional means of transportation (road, water, air, and rail) tend to be some mix

of expensive, slow, and environmentally harmful. Road travel is particularly

problematic, given carbon emissions and the fluctuating price of oil. As the

environmental dangers of energy consumption continue to worsen, mass transit will

be crucial in the years to come.
</p>
  <p>Rail travel is relatively energy efficient and offers the most environmentally friendly

option, but is too slow and expensive to be massively adopted. At distances less than

900 miles, supersonic travel is unfeasible, as most of the journey would be spent

ascending and descending (the slowest parts of a flight.) Given these issues, the

Hyperloop aims to make a cost-effective, high speed transportation system for use at

moderate distances. As an example of the right type of distance, Musk uses the route

from San Francisco to L.A. (a route the high-speed rail system will also cover). The

Hyperloop tubes would have solar panels installed on the roof, allowing for a clean

and self-powering system. </p>

  <p>There are of course drawbacks. Most notably, moving through a tube at such high

speeds precludes large turns or changes in elevation. As a result, the system is

optimal for straightforward trips across relatively level terrain.

California is, of course, susceptible to earthquakes, and the Hyperloop design takes

this into account. The tubes would be mounted on a series of pylons spread along the

route, each pylon placed every 100 feet or so. The pylons will allow for slip due to

thermal expansion and earthquakes, ensuring that the tubes will not be broken by

any such movement.</p>
<p>Realistically, the most important problem in getting any project off the ground is

money, doubly so when talking about a public work. Even if one can produce an

impressive blueprint, there are still issues of public approval, legislation, regulations,

and contractors to worry about. Fortunately, The Hyperloop would be a cost-saving

measure, especially when measured against the corpulent rail project currently

underway. Musk’s white paper for the Hyperloop estimates the total cost could be

kept under six billion dollars. Meanwhile, phase one of the California high-speed rail

project is expected to cost at least $68 billion.</p>
