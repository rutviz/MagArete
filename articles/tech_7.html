  <div id="name"><center>OUR WORLD IS GOING ON NEW

GENERATION OF TECHNOLOGY AND

POLLUTION FREE VEHICLE</center></div>
  
  <article class="content">
   <p><i>We all know </i> the we have less Fossil Fuel,Wood but we use it freely, no saving for future..!! what

is happen when the fossil fuel is finish..?? Have you think about it..??</p>

  <p>I know that you will say we use sun energy or wind energy or nuclear energy etc ,but what you

will use in you vehicle...</p>

 

  <p >ya it&#39;s true that you will use the other sources of energy in our regular requirements but how

you use this energy in vehicle have any idea..?? i have a one, using this we can operate our

vehicle on electric energy.The using of technology is going on new generation.</p>

  
  <p style="font-size:25px; background-color:#eeeeee;padding:10px;">Today I am going to say about THE WORLD FIRST ELECRIC ROAD, Yes... THE WORLD FIRST

ELECRIC ROAD.</p>
  <p>The World’s first electric road opens in Sweden,The world´s first electric road is being

inaugurated near the city of Gavle in central Sweden,the result of a unique partnership

demonstrating the path towards fossil-free transportation.

At now the road is only usuing by scania trucks,because it&#39;s maked by scania group, Scania is

supplying with the electrically-powered trucks, which is operate under real traffic conditions.</p>

  <p>Opened 22 June, the two-kilometer strip on the E16 motorway sees electrified trucks from

Scania driven in open traffic, using conductive technology developed by Siemens.

The beauty of the new technology, which is the result of several years of cooperation between

the Swedish Government and the private sector, is that it permits the trucks to operate as

electric vehicles when on the electrified road and as regular hybrid vehicles at other times. All

the Scania trucks on the road are hybrid and Euro 6-certified, running on biofuel.<p>
 
  
  <p>Scania’s head of Research and Development Claes Erixon, sayed, “The electric road is one

important milestone on the journey towards fossil-free transport. Scania is committed to the

success of this project and is committed to sustainable transport solutions.”</p>
  <p>The truck receives electrical power from a pantograph power collector that is mounted on the

frame behind its cab. The pantographs are in turn connected to overhead power lines that are

above the right-hand lane of the road, and the trucks can freely connect to and disconnect from

the overhead wires while in motion.</p>
  <p>When the truck goes outside the electrically-powered lane, the pantograph is disconnected and

the truck is then powered by the combustion engine or the battery- operated electric motor.

The same principle applies when the driver wants to overtake another vehicle while on the

electrified strip of the road.
  </p>
  <p>Scania´s sees the electric road as being a key component in achieving Sweden’s ambition of an

energy-efficient and fossil-free vehicle fleet by 2030. It can also help to strengthen Sweden’s

competitiveness in the rapidly-developing area of sustainable transport.</p>
  <p>Nils-Gunnar Vagstedt, who is responsible for Scania’s research into electrification, adds, “The

potential fuel savings through electrification are considerable and the technology can become a

cornerstone for fossil-free road transport services.”</p>
  <p>The investment in the Electric Road E16 program in Gavle is result of a program for the public

procurement of innovative solutions that was launched by Swedish authorities. The program

consists of about SEK 77 million in public money, with about SEK 48 million in co-financing from

the business community and the Gavleborg regional authority, which administers the area of

Sweden where the electric road is situated.</p>
  <p>The Swedish transport authority Trafikverket, the Swedish Energy Agency Energimyndigheten,

innovation agency Vinnova, Scania and Siemens are the main funders of the technology, while

Region Gavleborg is the project coordinator.</p>
  <p>The electric road is only one of several pioneering technologies that Scania is working on to help

the spread of sustainable solutions within both urban and long-haul transport. The company is

also developing technologies for alternative fuels, hybridised and fully-electric vehicles, and

autonomously and wirelessly-connected transport in parallel with its work to further enhance

and refine the products of the future.</p>
